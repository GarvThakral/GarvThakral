## 🚀 What I Build

- **Bengali NLI System**: Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-Large (with LoRA) for Bengali premise-hypothesis classification, achieving 84% F1-score.
- **Document Intelligence & QA System**: Custom RAG pipeline for 1,000+ documents, built using SentenceTransformers, ChromaDB, LangChain, Gemini, and AWS Lambda.
- **Emotion Drift Monitoring System (EDM)**: YouTube comment analytics with DistilBERT, ZenML, MLflow, and Streamlit, detecting and alerting on emotion drift.
- **Sales Call Conversion Analyzer**: NLP pipeline predicting conversion likelihood for sales calls and generating tailored follow-up emails with GPT-4o.
- **Image Classification via ResNet-50**: CNN-based classifier, trained and deployed with Flask API and Docker, achieving 87.6% accuracy.
- **Dex CLI**: Flagship C++ developer tool for project scaffolding, Git automation, and workflow ops.
- **SkillTrade**: Token-driven platform for skill exchange with real-time video calls and chat.
- **Job Dashboard**: AI-powered job tracker that parses listings and generates resume recommendations.
